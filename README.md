<h1>SQL for Data Science with R
<h2>MODULE 1: Getting Started with SQL</h2>
I learned the fundamentals of Structured Query Language (SQL) and how it is used to extract and manipulate data from relational databases. Understanding SQL is crucial for data science in R, as it allows me to access and analyze structured data efficiently. I practiced writing and executing basic SQL statements in a live database environment, gaining hands-on experience in querying data.

<h2>MODULE 2: Introduction to Relational Databases and Tables</h2>
I explored the core principles of relational databases, including how data is structured into tables and the relationships between them. I created a database instance and worked with SQL commands to build and manipulate tables. This hands-on experience allowed me to understand how databases are designed and managed for efficient data storage and retrieval.

<h2>MODULE 3: Intermediate SQL</h2>
I advanced my SQL skills by learning how to search data using string patterns and ranges, as well as how to organize and group query results effectively. I also practiced writing nested queries and executing select statements to retrieve data from multiple tables, enhancing my ability to work with complex datasets.

<h2>MODULE 4: Getting Started with Databases using R</h2>
I learned how to integrate R with relational databases, enabling me to efficiently retrieve, manipulate, and analyze large datasets. I explored the similarities between R data frames and database tables, including how different data types align and when conversions are necessary. Additionally, I gained experience in connecting to databases using various methods and saving database objects within R.
 
<h2>MODULE 5: Working with Database Objects using R</h2>
I deepened my understanding of working with databases in R by learning how to design and implement both logical and physical database models. I created database objects, populated them with data, and performed SQL queries within the R environment. This experience allowed me to manage databases effectively and retrieve meaningful insights using R.

<h2>MODULE 6: Course Project</h2>
I applied my SQL and R skills to analyze real-world datasets, including Canadian Crop Data and Exchange Rates. I formulated and executed SQL queries to extract relevant insights, just as a data professional would in a real-world scenario. The project tested my ability to structure queries correctly and interpret results, solidifying my expertise in database querying and analysis.
